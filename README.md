# knn-document-classification

This is a university lab work for my Machine Learning 2 course.

The goal was to build a document classifier using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. I worked on canvas provided by the professor that I had to fill in. Once the classifier was built, I studied the influence of some hyperparameters (value of k, weighting the neighbors or not, euclidian distance or cosine) on the accuracy achieved on a test set.

The corpus we worked on came from the « reuters21578 » collection, where documents are annotated with their topics. We worked with a simplified version where each document is associated with only one topic.

Instructions for this lab can be found [here](https://github.com/lina-conti/knn-document-classification/blob/main/instructions_knn.pdf).

I submitted this work in February 2022.
